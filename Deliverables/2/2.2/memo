Changes in the Player Module:

1) We no longer need the player_number_generator() function.

2) For player_option_picker():
    -> rename function to pick_number_or_card()
    -> Should return the declared number if user wants to keep the declared number
    -> Should return -1 if user wants to choose the card given by the administrator
    CONTRACT: function can only be called once before notify_of_verdict() is called.

3) We need a new function, notify_of_verdict() that takes:
    -> win: a boolean that is True if the player has won, False otherwise
    -> prints a message to notify the player that they won or lost.
    -> returns nothing. The admin does not expect anything from this function.
    CONTRACT: notify_of_verdict() can only be called once before player_option_picker() is called.
